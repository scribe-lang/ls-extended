# ls-extended

Port of my [ls_extended](https://github.com/Electrux/ls_extended) program, in Scribe

NOTE: This implementation does not contain icons. I got bored of them.

## Usage

To compile the project, just run `scribe build -r`. This will generate a binary `build/rel/ls-extended` which can be used as desired.

To see the usage info, run `build/rel/ls-extended -h` or `build/rel/ls-extended --help`.
