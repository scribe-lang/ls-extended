# ls-extended

Port of my [ls_extended](https://github.com/Electrux/ls_extended) program, in Scribe

NOTE: This implementation does not contain icons. I got bored of them.

## Usage

To compile the project, just run `scribe -O 2 main.sc`. This will generate a binary `main` which can be renamed and used as desired.

To see the usage info, run `./main -h` or `./main --help`.
